# ✍️ KPI Model: Keep Presence (1–3)

- **KPI 1** → Keep Presence(1): Grounding signal  
- **KPI 2** → Keep Presence(2): Movement with intent  
- **KPI 3** → Keep Presence(3): Echo with clarity  

Each KPI should be logged with:

- Timestamp  
- Mood signature  
- Reflection or signal notice  
- Completion or carry-forward status
