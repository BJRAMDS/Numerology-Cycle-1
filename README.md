### 🧠 INIT PR: Numerology Cycle-1 — TITAN Runtime Layer

**Date:** 05/23/2025  
**Numerology:** 1 (Initiation, Identity, Presence)

---

### ✅ Summary of Changes
- Added `numerologyEmitterEngine.js`: enhanced event engine for symbolic task tracking

TODO: 
- Implemented `scripts/setup.js`: prints daily tasks, current numerology phase, and checklist
- Standardized `identity-tracker/` and `logs/` with `.gitkeep` structure
- Clean `.gitignore` created (node_modules, logs)
- Added symbolic summaries via `phaseClock()` and middleware-ready emitters

---

### 🚀 Why This Matters
- Sets foundation for all future numerological cycles (2–9)
- Enables symbolic runtime introspection for dev logs
- Bridges numerology + identity + development state in an operational runtime
